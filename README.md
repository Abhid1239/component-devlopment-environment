# Component Development Environment

This is a clone of storybook to test your component designing skills by creating a single component of oxygen using any js/ts or css/scss/tailwind. You can improve your component designing and development skills here.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console. Here you can test your components as you are using in any browser or consuming it on any webpage.

### `npm run stroybook` or `yarn run storybook`

Runs the Storybook in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console. Here you can develop and test components w.r.t csf format just like we do in oxygen a familiar environment.

### `npm run watch:css` or `yarn run watch:csss`

Starts Tailwind compiler so that you can use tailwind in storybook you can refer this page if there are any issues present in consuming tailwind and it's working https://storybook.js.org/recipes/tailwindcss.


## Deploy Your Own

This library is autodeployable when code is merged in master. See to it that only approved PR's are merged in master

  Stepbar -- ritik 


## Develpoment Timeline and how to develop:

Developmemt or completion of component should be done in 3 phases as written below:

### Designing or Documentation Phase
Before development of the component a thorough idea should be there how are you going to develop this components a written docx or mdx should be made of how you will be deisgning it which props are required how many states there will be require any optimizations techinque which you would like to apply.
Hold your horses for 5 days strictly give time for designing take time to watch videos how component is develop what design patterns i should adhere too how should i style the component?, what will happen if the prop is changed. everthing should be clear in your mind how are you going to develop the component. (This would be the hardest part since you don't have to code just think and figure out how would you develop things make small mocks of small features test it figure it out whether it will work but don't start the development this will improve a lot of your thinking process).
After completion of it share it with each other get approvals of it and then after approval of more than 2 people start the development.


### Development Phase
Develop the whole component nad see to it that every edge case is handled. Try to figure out every edge case use most optimal methods to develop features. Test it out with real life testing option added in above option. Try to write clean code as much as possible build utils if you think they can be used again. Build small files if you think they are dependencies which can be sperated. If done early try to optimize the feature you have build. (Willl add testing phase in the future)

### Review & Deployment Phase
After development is done see to it that more than 2 approvala are there on your Component. See to it that the reviewer is taking time and reviewing every feature possible. If by any reason if you have missed any feature properly write there which feature is missing as a TODO:.
After Aproval is done we will merge the branch and then deploy the pacakage with your own name.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€


### NOTE: Try to be as open as possible while development don't go for completion go for learnings and understanding. Don't copy the code at all understand it only then use it any function till you don't understand don't leave the topic.



## Deadlines for this specfic Completion are:
### 28th 29th Designing Phase
### 4th 5th Development Phase
### 7th 8th Code Review and deployment Phase

### This timming are to push your limits not for you to complete in certain time if you think you require more time don't sleep but don't use an easier Method

## All the best ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
